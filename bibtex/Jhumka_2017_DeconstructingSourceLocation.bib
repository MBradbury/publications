    abstract = "Source location privacy (SLP) is becoming an important property for a large class of security-critical wireless sensor network applications such as monitoring and tracking. Much of the previous work on SLP have focused on the development of various protocols to enhance the level of SLP imparted to the network, under various attacker models and other conditions. Others works have focused on analysing the level of SLP being imparted by a specific protocol. In this paper, we focus on deconstructing routing-based SLP protocols to enable a better understanding of their structure. We argue that the SLP-aware routing protocols can be classified into two main categories, namely (i) spatial and (ii) temporal. Based on this, we show that there are three important components, namely (i) decoy selection, (ii) use and routing of control messages and (iii) use and routing of decoy messages. The decoy selection technique imparts the spatial or temporal property of SLP-aware routing. We show the viability of the framework through the construction of well-known SLP-aware routing protocols using the identified components.",
