    abstract = "Source location privacy (SLP) is becoming an important property for a large class of security-critical wireless sensor network applications such as monitoring and tracking. Many routing protocols have been proposed that provide SLP, all of which provide a trade-off between SLP and energy. Experiments have been conducted to gauge the performance of the proposed protocols under different network parameters such as noise levels. As that there exists a plethora of protocols which contain a set of possibly conflicting performance attributes, it is difficult to select the SLP protocol that will provide the best trade-offs across them for a given application with specific requirements. In this paper, we propose a methodology where SLP protocols are first profiled to capture their performance under various protocol configurations. Then, we present a novel decision theoretic procedure for selecting the most appropriate SLP routing algorithm for the application and network under investigation. We show the viability of our approach through different case studies.",
