    abstract = "Source Location Privacy (SLP) is becoming important for wireless sensor networks where the source of messages is kept hidden from an attacker. In this paper, we conjecture that similar traffic perturbation to altering the routing protocol can be achieved at the link layer through assignment of time slots to nodes. This paper presents a multi-objective optimisation problem where SLP, schedule latency and final attacker distance are criteria. We employ genetic algorithms to generate Pareto-optimal schedules using two fitness criteria, examining the Pareto efficiency of selecting either and confirming the efficiency by performing simulations which show a near optimal capture ratio.",
