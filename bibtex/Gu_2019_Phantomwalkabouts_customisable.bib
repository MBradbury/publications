    abstract = "Summary Source location privacy (SLP) is an important property for a large class of security-critical wireless sensor network (WSN) applications such as monitoring and tracking. In the seminal work on SLP, phantom routing was proposed as a viable approach to address SLP. However, recent work has shown some limitations of phantom routing such as poor data yield and low SLP. In this paper, we propose phantom walkabouts, a novel and more general version of phantom routing, which performs phantom routes of variable lengths. Through extensive simulations, we show that phantom walkabouts provides high SLP level than phantom routing under specific network configuration.",
