    abstract = "The space sector is changing from state-supported space exploration to commercial space exploration, giving rise to NewSpace. The role of small to medium sized enterprises (SMEs) in this rapid growth is increasing, but experience in other sectors shows SMEs may not be sufficiently focused on cyber security issues. In this exploratory study, we investigated the Influence of New Entrants to the Space Industry on Cybersecurity, according to industry stakeholders. To explore this question, we carried out 8 semi structured interviews with NewSpace organisations directly involved in the design, development or review of space system devices and services, including SMEs, large businesses, governmental and not for profit, non-governmental organisations (NGOs). Our findings highlight crucial areas in cybersecurity which may be influenced by the advent of new entrants to the space industry, such as technology infrastructure, philosophical approaches to cybersecurity maturity, vulnerability disclosure culture, and regulatory aspects. These are the areas where intervention to promote healthy cybersecurity practices can be directed and be achieved through collaborations amongst the developers, end users and regulators.",
