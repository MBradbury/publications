The source location privacy (SLP) problem involves protecting the location of a WSN source node from an attacker who is attempting to locate it. Among the most promising approaches to the SLP problem is the use of fake sources, with much existing research demonstrating their efficacy. Despite the effectiveness of the approach, the most effective algorithms providing SLP require network and situational knowledge that makes their deployment impractical in many contexts. In this paper, we develop a novel dynamic fake sources-based algorithm for SLP. We show that the algorithm provides state-of-the-art levels of location privacy under practical operational assumptions.},

  abstract  = {As interest in using Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) for deployments in scenarios such as asset monitoring increases, the need to consider security and privacy issues also becomes greater. One such issue is that of Source Location Privacy (SLP) where the location of a source in the network needs to be kept secret from a malicious attacker. Many techniques have been proposed to provide SLP against an eavesdropping attacker. Most techniques work by first developing an algorithm followed by extensive performance validation. Differently, in this paper, we model the SLP problem as an Integer Linear Programming optimization problem. Using the IBM ILOG CPLEX optimiser, we obtain an optimal solution to provide SLP. However, that solution is centralised (i.e., requires network-wide knowledge) making the solution unsuitable for WSNs. Therefore, we develop a distributed version of the solution and evaluate the level of privacy provided by it. The solution is hybrid in nature, in that it uses both spatial and temporal redundancy to provide SLP. Results from extensive simulations using the TOSSIM WSN simulator indicate a 1% capture ratio is achievable as a trade-off for an increase in the delivery latency.},

This paper addresses this shortcoming by conducting an in-depth investigation of phantom routing under various network configurations. The results presented demonstrate that previous work in phantom routing does not generalise well to different network configurations. Specifically, under certain configurations, it is shown that the afforded SLP is reduced by a factor of up to 75.},

One such property is source location privacy (SLP). The original SLP problem is to protect the location of a source node in a WSN from a single distributed eavesdropper attacker. Several techniques have been proposed to address the SLP problem, and most of them use some form of traffic analysis and engineering to provide enhanced SLP. The use of fake sources is considered to be promising for providing SLP, and several works have investigated the effectiveness of the fake sources approach under various attacker models. However, very little work has been done to understand the theoretical underpinnings of the fake source technique. In this paper, we (i) provide a novel formalisation of the fake sources selection problem; (ii) prove the fake sources selection problem to be NP-complete; (iii) provide parametric heuristics for three different network configurations; and (iv) show that these heuristics provide (near) optimal levels of SLP under appropriate parameterisation. Our results show that fake sources can provide a high level of SLP. Our work is the first to investigate the theoretical underpinnings of the fake source technique.

These applications will have to guarantee that the location of the occurrence of specific events is kept private from attackers, in what is called the source location privacy (SLP) problem. Fake sources have been used in numerous techniques, however, the solution’s efficiency is typically achieved by fine-tuning parameters at compile time. This is undesirable as WSN conditions may change. In this paper, we first present an SLP algorithm – Dynamic  – that estimates the relevant parameters at runtime and show that it provides a high level of SLP, albeit at the expense of a high number of messages. To address this, we provide a hybrid online algorithm – DynamicSPR  – that uses directed random walks for the fake sources allocation strategy to reduce energy usage. We perform simulations of the various protocols we present and our results show that DynamicSPR provides a similar level of SLP as when parameters are optimised at compile-time, with a lower number of messages sent.},

The objective of this paper is to investigate the novel problem of developing a TDMA MAC schedule that can provide SLP. We make a number of important contributions: (i) we develop a novel formalisation of a class of eavesdropping attackers and provide novel formalisations of SLP-aware data aggregation schedules (DAS), (ii) we present a decision procedure to verify whether a DAS schedule is SLP-aware, that returns a counterexample if the schedule is not, similar to model checking, and (iii) we develop a 3-stage distributed algorithm that transforms an initial DAS algorithm into a corresponding SLP-aware schedule against a specific class of eavesdroppers. Our simulation results show that the resulting SLP-aware DAS protocol reduces the capture ratio by 50% at the expense of negligable message overhead.},

Although no solution exists to provide source location privacy over an extended period, it has been shown that attackers can be sufficiently inhibited by prominent approaches that use either a phantom node, via which protocol messages are routed, or nodes assigned to be fake sources, each of which then broadcast fake messages. However, the applicability of fake source approaches to networks where location privacy must be maintained for multiple sources has yet to be considered. This paper addresses this issue by analysing a representative fake source algorithm in the context of multiple sources, presenting simulation results that demonstrate the shortcomings of the approach and identifying the underlying limitations to pave the way for the development of algorithms capable of accounting for multiple sources.},

Other work has focused on analysing the level of SLP being imparted by a specific protocol. In this paper, we adopt a different approach where we model the attacker movement as a time series and use information theoretic concepts to infer the properties of a routing protocol that imparts high levels of SLP. We propose the notion of a properly competing path that causes an attacker to “stall” when moving towards the source. This concept provides the basis for developing a perturbation model, similar to those in privacy-preserving data mining. We then show how to use properly competing paths to develop properties of an SLP-aware routing protocol. Further, we show how different SLP-aware routing protocols can be obtained through different instantiations of the framework. Those instantiations are obtained based on a notion of information loss achieved through the use of the perturbation model proposed.},

However, there has been little research in the area of many-to-many communication. Many-to-many communication in WSNs is a growing application area, with examples including fire detection in both natural and urban areas, and the monitoring of heating and air conditioning within buildings. In this paper, we propose a scalable many-to-many routing protocol that makes use of Ant Colony Optimisation (ACO) that is applicable for an arbitrary number of sources and sinks. The protocol aggregates data sent from multiple sources into a single, shared backbone of nodes to reduce the total number of packets sent and so increase network lifetime. Results from simulations using the Cooja Network simulator show that the protocol is able to achieve packet delivery ratios above 95%, with the algorithm becoming more efficient with larger networks, sending fewer packets relative to the size of the networks, as well as involving fewer nodes in routing.},

  abstract = {Summary Source location privacy (SLP) is an important property for a large class of security-critical wireless sensor network (WSN) applications such as monitoring and tracking. In the seminal work on SLP, phantom routing was proposed as a viable approach to address SLP. However, recent work has shown some limitations of phantom routing such as poor data yield and low SLP. In this paper, we propose phantom walkabouts, a novel and more general version of phantom routing, which performs phantom routes of variable lengths. Through extensive simulations, we show that phantom walkabouts provides high SLP level than phantom routing under specific network configuration.},
