  abstract = {Source location privacy (SLP) is becoming an important property for a large class of security-critical wireless sensor network applications such as monitoring and tracking. Many routing protocols have been proposed that provide SLP, all of which provide a trade-off between SLP and energy. Experiments have been conducted to gauge the performance of the proposed protocols under different network parameters such as noise levels. As that there exists a plethora of protocols which contain a set of possibly conflicting performance attributes, it is difficult to select the SLP protocol that will provide the best trade-offs across them for a given application with specific requirements. In this paper, we propose a methodology where SLP protocols are first profiled to capture their performance under various protocol configurations. Then, we present a novel decision theoretic procedure for selecting the most appropriate SLP routing algorithm for the application and network under investigation. We show the viability of our approach through different case studies.},

  abstract  = {As interest in using Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) for deployments in scenarios such as asset monitoring increases, the need to consider security and privacy issues also becomes greater. One such issue is that of Source Location Privacy (SLP) where the location of a source in the network needs to be kept secret from a malicious attacker. Many techniques have been proposed to provide SLP against an eavesdropping attacker. Most techniques work by first developing an algorithm followed by extensive performance validation. Differently, in this paper, we model the SLP problem as an Integer Linear Programming optimization problem. Using the IBM ILOG CPLEX optimiser, we obtain an optimal solution to provide SLP. However, that solution is centralised (i.e., requires network-wide knowledge) making the solution unsuitable for WSNs. Therefore, we develop a distributed version of the solution and evaluate the level of privacy provided by it. The solution is hybrid in nature, in that it uses both spatial and temporal redundancy to provide SLP. Results from extensive simulations using the TOSSIM WSN simulator indicate a 1% capture ratio is achievable as a trade-off for an increase in the delivery latency.},

Fake sources have been used in numerous techniques, however, the solution’s efficiency is typically achieved by fine-tuning parameters at compile time. This is undesirable as WSN conditions may change. In this paper, we first present an SLP algorithm – Dynamic  – that estimates the relevant parameters at runtime and show that it provides a high level of SLP, albeit at the expense of a high number of messages. To address this, we provide a hybrid online algorithm – DynamicSPR  – that uses directed random walks for the fake sources allocation strategy to reduce energy usage. We perform simulations of the various protocols we present and our results show that DynamicSPR provides a similar level of SLP as when parameters are optimised at compile-time, with a lower number of messages sent.},

We make a number of important contributions: (i) we develop a novel formalisation of a class of eavesdropping attackers and provide novel formalisations of SLP-aware data aggregation schedules (DAS), (ii) we present a decision procedure to verify whether a DAS schedule is SLP-aware, that returns a counterexample if the schedule is not, similar to model checking, and (iii) we develop a 3-stage distributed algorithm that transforms an initial DAS algorithm into a corresponding SLP-aware schedule against a specific class of eavesdroppers. Our simulation results show that the resulting SLP-aware DAS protocol reduces the capture ratio by 50% at the expense of negligable message overhead.},

Although no solution exists to provide source location privacy over an extended period, it has been shown that attackers can be sufficiently inhibited by prominent approaches that use either a phantom node, via which protocol messages are routed, or nodes assigned to be fake sources, each of which then broadcast fake messages. However, the applicability of fake source approaches to networks where location privacy must be maintained for multiple sources has yet to be considered.

This concept provides the basis for developing a perturbation model, similar to those in privacy-preserving data mining. We then show how to use properly competing paths to develop properties of an SLP-aware routing protocol. Further, we show how different SLP-aware routing protocols can be obtained through different instantiations of the framework. Those instantiations are obtained based on a notion of information loss achieved through the use of the perturbation model proposed.},

Many-to-many communication in WSNs is a growing application area, with examples including fire detection in both natural and urban areas, and the monitoring of heating and air conditioning within buildings. In this paper, we propose a scalable many-to-many routing protocol that makes use of Ant Colony Optimisation (ACO) that is applicable for an arbitrary number of sources and sinks. The protocol aggregates data sent from multiple sources into a single, shared backbone of nodes to reduce the total number of packets sent and so increase network lifetime. Results from simulations using the Cooja Network simulator show that the protocol is able to achieve packet delivery ratios above 95%, with the algorithm becoming more efficient with larger networks, sending fewer packets relative to the size of the networks, as well as involving fewer nodes in routing.},

  abstract  = {Autonomous robotic systems such as Connected and Autonomous Vehicle (CAV) systems are both safety-and security-critical, since a breach in system security may impact safety. Generally, safety and security concerns for such systems are treated separately during the development process. In this paper, we consider an algorithm for sending Cooperative Awareness Messages (CAMs) between vehicles in a CAV system and the use of CAMs in preventing vehicle collisions. We employ threat analysis techniques that are commonly used in the cyber security domain to guide our formal verification. This allows us to focus our formal methods on those security properties that are particularly important and to consider both safety and security in tandem. Our analysis centres on identifying STRIDE security properties and we illustrate how these can be formalised, and subsequently verified, using a combination of formal tools for distinct aspects, namely Promela/SPIN and Dafny.},

Due to this large quantity of traffic, there will be Quality of Service (QoS) constraints on the system that means messages will need to be prioritised. As vehicles will have a finite buffer to hold messages, the prioritisation scheme must consider network throughput to ensure QoS requirements are met. In our throughput authentication prioritisation technique, a Markov model is used to detect abnormally large data traffic users who are potential attackers performing a Denial of Service (DoS). Our results show that the algorithm can efficiently enhance network throughput.},

Such functionality exposes CAVs to new attacks that current vehicles will not face. To ensure the safety and security of CAVs, it is important to be able to identify the ways in which the system could be attacked and to build defences against these attacks. One possible approach is to use reference architectures to perform an attack surface analysis. Existing research has developed a variety of reference architectures but none for the specific purpose of attack surface analysis. Existing approaches are either too simple for sufficiently detailed modelling or require too many details to be specified to easily analyse a CAV’s attack surface. Therefore, we propose a reference architecture using a hybrid Functional-Communication viewpoint for attack surface analysis of CAVs, including the Devices, Edge and Cloud systems CAVs interact with. Using two case studies, we demonstrate how attack trees can be used to understand the attack surface of CAV systems.},

The advent of the Internet of Space Things, coupled with the commercialisation of space has resulted in an ecosystem that is difficult to control and brings about new security challenges. In such critical systems, it is common to conduct verification strategies to ensure that the underpinning software is correct. Formal verification is achieved by modelling the system and verifying that the model obeys particular functional and safety properties. Many connected systems are now the target of a variety of threat actors attempting to realise different goals. Threat modelling is the approach employed to analyse and manage the threats from adversaries. Common practice is that these two approaches are conducted independently of one another. In this paper, we argue that the two should be mutually informed, and describe a methodology for security-minded formal verification that combines these analysis techniques. This approach will streamline the development process and give a more formal grounding to the security properties identified during threat analysis.},

In this paper, we propose phantom walkabouts, a novel and more general version of phantom routing, which performs phantom routes of variable lengths. Through extensive simulations, we show that phantom walkabouts provides high SLP level than phantom routing under specific network configuration.},

  abstract = {Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are collections of small computing devices that are used to monitor valuable assets such as endangered animals. As WSNs communicate wirelessly they leak information to malicious eavesdroppers. When monitoring assets it is important to provide Source Location Privacy (SLP), where the location of the message source must be kept hidden. Many SLP protocols have been developed by designing a protocol using intuition before evaluating its performance. However, this does not provide insight into how to develop optimal approaches. This thesis will present an alternate approach where the SLP problem is modelled using different techniques to give an optimal output. However, as this optimal output is typically for a restricted scenario, algorithms that trade optimality for generality are subsequently designed. Four main contributions are presented. First, an analysis is performed based on entropy and divergence to gain insight into how to reduce the information an attacker gains via the use of competing paths, and ways to compare the information loss of arbitrary routing protocols. Secondly, the SLP problem is modelled using Integer Linear Programming. The model result guides the design of a generic protocol called ILPRouting that groups messages together to reduce the moves an attacker makes. Thirdly, a timing analysis of when events occur is used to dynamically determine fake source parameters for the Dynamic and DynamicSPR algorithms. These fake sources lure the attacker to their location instead of the real source. Finally, the first SLP-aware duty cycle is investigated, and implemented for DynamicSPR to make it more energy efficient. These techniques are evaluated through simulations and deployments on WSN testbeds to demonstrate their effectiveness.},

  abstract   = {Source Location Privacy (SLP) is an important property for monitoring assets in privacy-critical sensor network and Internet of Things applications. Many SLP-aware routing techniques exist, with most striking a tradeoff between SLP and other key metrics such as energy (due to battery power). Typically, the number of messages sent has been used as a proxy for the energy consumed. Existing work (for SLP against a local attacker) does not consider the impact of sleeping via duty cycling to reduce the energy cost of an SLP-aware routing protocol. Therefore, two main challenges exist: (i) how to achieve a low duty cycle without loss of control messages that configure the SLP protocol and (ii) how to achieve high SLP without requiring a long time spent awake. In this article, we present a novel formalisation of a duty cycling protocol as a transformation process. Using derived transformation rules, we present the first duty cycling protocol for an SLP-aware routing protocol for a local eavesdropping attacker. Simulation results on grids demonstrate a duty cycle of 10%, while only increasing the capture ratio of the source by 3 percentage points, and testbed experiments on FlockLab demonstrate an 80% reduction in the average current draw.},

A shortcoming of existing work is that it tends to focus on a specific aspect of privacy leakage when attempting to protect location privacy. In doing so, interactions between privacy threats are not considered. In this work, we investigate the privacy surface of a vehicle by considering the many different ways in which location privacy can be leaked. Following this, we identify techniques to protect privacy and that it is insufficient to provide location privacy against a single threat vector. A methodology to calculate the interactions of privacy preserving techniques is used to highlight the need to consider the wider threat landscape and for techniques to collaborate to ensure location privacy is provided against multiple sources of privacy threats where possible.},

These devices are typically resource-constrained and are unable to perform resource-intensive computations. Therefore, these jobs need to be offloaded to resource-rich nodes at the edge of the IoT network for execution. However, the timeliness and correctness of edge nodes may not be trusted (such as during high network load or attack). In this paper, we look at the applicability of trust for successful offloading. Traditionally, trust is computed at the application level, with suitable mechanisms to adjust for factors such as recency. However, these do not work well in IoT networks due to resource constraints. We propose a novel device called Trust Tracker (denoted by Σ) that provides higher-level applications with up-to-date trust information of the resource-rich nodes. We prove impossibility results regarding computation offloading and show that Σ is necessary and sufficient for correct offloading. We show that, Σ cannot be implemented even in a synchronous network and we compute the probability of offloading to a bad node, which we show to be negligible when a majority of nodes are correct. We perform a small-scale deployment to demonstrate our approach.},

Due to their resource constraints, IoT devices may be unable to compute these tasks and will offload them to more powerful resource-rich edge nodes. However, as edge nodes may not necessarily behave as expected, an IoT device needs to be able to select which edge node should execute its tasks. This selection problem can be addressed by using a measure of behavioural trust of the edge nodes delivering a correct response, based on historical information about past interactions with edge nodes that are stored in memory. However, due to their constrained memory capacity, IoT devices will only be able to store a limited amount of trust information, thereby requiring an eviction strategy when its memory is full of which there has been limited investigation in the literature. To address this, we develop the concept of the memory profile of an agent and that profile’s utility. We formalise the profile eviction problem in a unified profile memory model and show it is NP-complete. To circumvent the inherent complexity, we study the performance of eviction algorithms in a partitioned profile memory model using our utility metric. Our results show that localised eviction strategies which only consider one specific type of information do not perform well. Thus we propose a novel eviction strategy that globally considers all types of trust information stored and we show that it outperforms local eviction strategies for the majority of memory sizes and agent behaviours. In this paper, we develop a concept of information utility to a trust model and formalise the problem of information eviction, which we prove to be NP-complete. We then investigate the usefulness of different eviction strategies to maximise the utility of information stored to enable trust-based task offloading.},

For performance bug diagnostics, tools that aid in the identification of said bugs, such as benchmarks and profilers, are commonly employed. However, due to factors such as insufficient workloads or ineffective benchmarks, software defects related to code inefficiencies are inherently difficult to diagnose. Hence, the capabilities of performance bug diagnostic tools are limited and performance bug instances may be missed. Traditional mutation testing (MT) is a technique for quantifying a test suite's ability to find functional bugs by mutating the code of the test subject. Similarly, we adopt performance mutation testing (PMT) to evaluate performance bug diagnostic tools and identify where improvements need to be made to a performance testing methodology. We carefully investigate the different performance bug fault models and how synthesized performance bugs based on these models can evaluate benchmarks and workload selection to help improve performance diagnostics. In this paper, we present the design of our PMT framework, SlowCoach, and evaluate it with over 1600 mutants from 4 real-world software projects.},

  abstract  = {Fuzzing is an automated testing technique that utilizes injection of random inputs in a target program to help uncover vulnerabilities. Performance fuzzing extends the classic fuzzing approach and generates inputs that trigger poor performance. During our evaluation of performance fuzzing tools, we have identified certain conventionally used assumptions that do not always hold true. Our research (re)evaluates PERFFUZZ in order to identify the limitations of current techniques, and guide the direction of future work for improvements to performance fuzzing. Our experimental results highlight two specific limitations. Firstly, we identify the assumption that the length of execution paths correlate to program performance is not always the case, and thus cannot reflect the quality of test cases generated by performance fuzzing. Secondly, the default testing parameters by the fuzzing process (timeouts and size limits) overly confine the input search space. Based on these observations, we suggest further investigation on performance fuzzing guidance, as well as controlled fuzzing and testing parameters.},
